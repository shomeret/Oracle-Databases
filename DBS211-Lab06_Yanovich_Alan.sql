/*

PLEASE NOTE: some of the questions regarding rollback commands were confusing
I have tried explaining my knowledge as much as possible
Also questions 19 to 22 were NOT in the notes ( it says comming soon ) 
So I have looked it up on Google.

    The user has established a new connection to the server and has a blank sheet ready to go, starts a new transaction
    The user uses the BEGIN statement in Oracle SQL, this will start a new transaction
    The user executes a COMMIT statement, the current transaction is commited, and a new transaction starts.
    The user executes ANY DDL statement.  This automatically triggers an auto-commit of the current transaction and starts a new transaction.
